			<h1>The IPO Model</h1>
			<p>
            The input-process-output (IPO) model, also known as the IPO+S model, is a functional model and conceptual schema of a general system. An IPO chart/table identifies a programâ€™s inputs, its outputs, and the processing steps required to transform the inputs into the outputs.<br />
				IPO+S stands for Input Processing Output + Storage.<br />
				The IPO Model makes it possible for users to interact with these electronic devices in a standard way without much difference between systems. The IPO Model is essential as it is the most simple way that electronics can work with user input, and all electronic devices work with the IPO Model.<br />
				In the simple IPO model, information is 'inputted' and then sent to the processor which processes it/manipulates the data then sends the outcome of the processing to the output device. A simple example of this would be moving a mouse on a table. The mouse collects the motion data and sends it to the processor, which takes that data and moves the cursor then draws and image, which it then sends to a screen where you can see the outcome of your hand moving the mouse on the table.
            </p>
            <h2>IPSCO Model</h2>
            <p>
                <a href="../src/img/IPO/IPSCO-Diagram.png" rel="shadowbox"><img src="../src/img/IPO/IPSCO-Diagram.png" class="medium right"/></a>
                The processing part of the IPO Model can be broken down into three sub sections for hardware - being Processing, Storage and Control. Thus the IPO model can become the IPSCO Model.

								A touch screen can also be considered a pointer device as you touch the part of the screen you would like to select or want the curser to go to. It registers touch input via a touch sensitive panel which is transparent and placed over a screen.

								A keyboard is an input device where the user presses on labelled buttons known as keys. The circuits are completed when the keys are press all/most of the way down. This causes an electric current to travel to the controller within the keyboard, which then sends a key-code signal to the computer.

								A microphone detects sound waves as analogue data when a tiny magnet vibrates within the microphone. Depending on the microphone the analogue audio data may be digitised and sent to the computer via a microphone jack or by USB.

								A screen is an large 2D array of pixels which consist of tiny LED in the colours Red, Green, and Blue. Screens are usually in the shape of a rectangle and have a backlight, which can have its brightness adjusted. Screens now take a digital signal as input but used to take analogue signals. It is used to display visual information to the user.

								Speakers are an output device which relays to the user audio information such as alert sounds, music, etc. It consists of a magnet inside a coil. The as the coil's polarity changes, the magnet vibrates, these vibrations create sound waves which are perceived as sound by the user. Depending on the speakers it can take analogue or digital signals but digital signals must be converted to analogue within the speakers before being played back.

								A haptic feedback device is a device that relays touch or other physical information to the user. This is commonly done by vibrating motors in phones or rumble packs. Other devices may zap the user or shift its weight. Haptic feedback devices are commonly used by hard core gamers as a way to experience to an extent what happens in the game. These devices are also used in phones such as when the user types, a short vibration is outputted to subtly indicate the user that it has registered the keystroke, as an alternative to the click of a physical keyboard.

								A printer is an output device which prints on paper what the user sees on screen by moving an ink jet across the page very quickly many times to create millions of colours out of the four main printer colours CMYK or Cyan Magenta Yellow Key(Black) by combining them in different ratios. Printers output (a) sheet(s) of paper.

								Braille Embossers are like printers but instead on ink on paper, it creates raised dots on a sheet of paper to create braille characters which the user can feel to retrieve information from it.

				            The touch screen is the new evolution with interacting with electronic devices, it is versatile and makes use of what is already on most consumer electronic devices, the screen. There are several types of touch screens the main two used today are resistive and capacitive.<br />
					Resistive touch screens are made of layers with a gap in between. When the screen is touched the pressure causes the layers to touch, they are coated with an resistive coating on one side so causes a current through while acting as a voltage divider on both axis. These currents are received by the other end of the screen and the location of the touch is calculated. Resistive touch screens are most commonly used in restaurants, factories and hospitals for its high resistance to liquids and contaminants. <br />
					Capacitive touch screens are made of an insulator such as glass coated with a conductive layer such as Iridium Tin Oxide. It calculate the location of a touch based on the distortion of the screens electrostatic field as a finger touches it. This works because the human body is an electrical conductor and touching the surface of the screen causes a distortion of the electrostatic field on the screen. Capacitive touchscreen are commonly used in mobile phones such as iPhones for more better touch location accuracy.

				            Haptic Feedback technology, or Haptics is a tactile feedback technology which recreates the sense of touch by applying forces, vibrations, or motions to the user. It is described as "Doing for the sense of touch what computer graphics does for vision.". A common everyday example of haptic feedback is in our MacBooks, or more precisely the trackpad. It is known as the "Tactile Trackpad" and provides the user with both the sound of a click and a physical feeling of pressing a button. Haptic feed back is also in our mobile devices. Companies such as Nokia, LG, Google, Samsung, and Sony use the vibrating motor inside their mobile devices to give tactile feedback when a button or more commonly, a key on a virtual keyboard is pressed. The user experience with touchscreens lacking tactile feedback or haptics can be difficult due to latency or other factors. Research from the University of Glasgow Scotland [Brewster, Chohan, and Brown 2007 and more recently Hogan] demonstrates that sample users reduce input errors (20%), increase input speed (20%), and lower their cognitive load (40%) when touchscreens are combined with haptics or tactile feedback [vs. non-haptic touchscreens].
